# name-generator
A random character name generator for sci-fi/fantasy settings.

## Languages
Language files specify the generation of names using a probabilistic
context-free grammar.

## Metalanguages
Additional output can be added to the generated names using "Metalanguages."
Metalanguages are specified in files similarly to languages. When multiple
metalanguages are active, they are applied sucessively to the generated output
in order of increasing priority.
